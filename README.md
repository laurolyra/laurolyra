Hi! I am an Brazilian ex-attorney, no longer working at the field, now working @ PagueVeloz ServiÃ§os de Pagamento as a front-end software developer, learning and fixing issues using angularJS.

I am also working at FlowBr as a frontend developer, creating components, webpages and modals in the SIGA portal Project, using **React** and **Material-UI**.

- ðŸ˜„ he/him/his

- ðŸŒ± During a 12-month web development course @ Trybe, I've learned the basics of front-end and back-end development, studying languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript (focusing on the React Framework). On the server side, I've developed some projects on MySQL, MongoDB and NodeJS. Some of them can be found in the pinned repositories here.

   [![laurolyra's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=laurolyra)](https://github.com/laurolyra/github-readme-stats)

- Besides the programming languages above, I'm really curious and looking for some mentors that could help me on my way throught learning **PHP** and other frontend frameworks, like **VUE**.

- ðŸ‘¯ I've collaborated to improve Trybe's course and live lectures as a Summer Job student. During 3 months, adopting Agile Methodologies, I've helped the entire course, bringing and improving content, removing unnecessary or confusing explanations and adding more examples to make every topic as clear as possible.

- ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª I think that communication is really important to have a healthy workplace environment, and I would like to mention that I have good soft and hard skills related to it - I've received great feedbacks about my nonviolent communication and I can speak Portuguese, English and German. Alles Klar?

- ðŸ“« If you'd like to know more about me, feel free to follow me on the networks below:
