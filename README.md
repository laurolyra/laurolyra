### Welcome to Lauro Lyra Aguiar's README
My name is Lauro Lyra Aguiar. I am an ex-attorney, no longer working at the field, and studying hard (@ [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com)) to be a software developer.
- ðŸ˜„ he/him/his

- ðŸŒ± During this 12-month course, I've learned the basics of front-end and back-end development, studying languages like HTML, CSS and <img src="https://devicons.github.io/devicon/devicon.git/icons/javascript/javascript-plain.svg" alt="JavaScript" width="15" height="15"/></a> (specially the framework React). on the server side, I've developed some projects on MySQL, MongoDB and NodeJS. All of them can be found on the repository **my projectys**, pinned here.

Besides the languages above, I'm really curious and looking for some mentors that could help me on my way throught learning python and PHP.

- ðŸ‘¯ I've collaborated to improve Trybe's course and live lectures as a Summer Job student. During 3 months, adopting Agile Methodology, I've helped the entire school to bring and produce better content, removing unnecessary or confusing explanations and adding more examples to make the content as clear as possible.
